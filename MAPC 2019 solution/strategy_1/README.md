# mapc_rhbp_example

This is a very basic example that shows how RHBP can be used within the Multiagent Programming Contest Scenario of 2019.

The implemented agents are exploring there environment by randomly moving around. Once they are able to perceive a dispenser 
in their vision range they approach it and start dispensing.


## Execution
